    "Faster RCNN is a fully learnt deep learning architecture for object detection. It is a somewhat more complex architecture compared to classification (object recognition) models. This is because object detection is a more complex task than object recognition since the network needs both to find the object within the image and to identify its class. Accordingly the network needs to produce two outputs for each object within an image:\n",

    "1. Parameters of a bounding box for the object - typically these will be the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the top-left corner of the box and its height and width - a regression task\n",

    "The architecture consists of two networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A region proposal network (RPN) which identifies candidate regions where an object might be found\n",
    "2. A region-based detection network that will determine whether or not an object of any of the classes exists within a given region\n",

    "The first layer of the network takes the feature map output by the backbone layers and passes it through a further convolutional layer that reduces the dimensions (number of channels) of the feature map without modifying the resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the network consists of an $n \\times n$ convolutional layer followed by two parallel $1 \\times 1$ convolutional layers denoted as the box-classification and box-regression layers. The box-regression layer outputs the four parameters of a bounding box. The box-classification layer treats the task of determining whether or not the bounding box contains an object as a two-class classification layer, where the classes are 'object' and 'not object'. \n",

    "It is also possible to think of this architecture as a tiny network that takes an $n \\times n$ input and is comprised of an $n \\times n$ convolutional layer followed by two parallel fully-connected classification and regression layers. In this interpretation we are sliding $n \\times n$  windows across the image and using each window as an input to the network.\n",
